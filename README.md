# UAP "Dog Whistle" üõ∏‚ùìü§î

A web-based audio experiment that generates a blend of continuous and periodic tones‚Äîincluding sub-audible modulations and high-frequency "dog whistle" sounds‚Äîto mimic a set of rumored "UAP summoning" signals.

## üéµ Sound Frequencies

The project implements several specific frequencies, each with its own characteristics:

- **7.83 Hz**: Simulated Schumann resonance using amplitude modulation
- **528 Hz**: "Love" or "Miracle" frequency
- **432 Hz**: Ambient pad tone
- **2.5 kHz**: Periodic chirp signal
- **17 kHz**: Near-ultrasonic tone
- **White Noise**: "Breath" layer with subtle modulation

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notice

The frequencies used in this experiment were suggested by an unverified source on X (formerly Twitter). This project was created as a programming exercise to demonstrate AI-assisted code generation and carries no scientific validity. It has no connection to the "Sky Watcher dog whistle" or any similar devices. The author makes no claims about the effectiveness or purpose of these frequencies, and this should be treated purely as an experimental demonstration.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

The project uses the Web Audio API to generate and mix multiple audio signals. The implementation includes:

- Multiple oscillators for different frequencies
- Amplitude modulation for the Schumann resonance simulation
- White noise generation with LFO modulation
- Periodic chirp and ultrasonic signals
- Gain control for each audio layer

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Safety Disclaimer

The sounds produced by this website are purely experimental and for entertainment or curiosity. There is no scientific guarantee that these tones have any real-world effects on unidentified aerial phenomena or biological systems. Some of the frequencies exceed the normal human hearing range, and their audibility may vary widely among individuals and audio equipment.

High-frequency sounds played at elevated volumes can risk hearing damage. Always monitor your volume levels and consider using professional audio equipment for any extended listening. The developer assumes no liability for damages or health issues resulting from misuse of these audio signals.
