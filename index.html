    <h2>‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notice</h2>
    <p>
      The frequencies used in this experiment were suggested by an unverified source on X (formerly Twitter). 
      This project was created as a programming exercise to demonstrate AI-assisted code generation and carries 
      no scientific validity. It has no connection to the "Skywatcher dog whistle" or similar devices reportedly 
      used at locations like Skinwalker Ranch, which are believed to rely on radio frequency (RF) signals‚Äînot audio frequencies.
    </p>
    <p>
      For detailed information about the RF-based approach reportedly associated with Skywatcher and Skinwalker Ranch, please refer to the section below titled <strong>"RF-Based 'Dog Whistles' and Related Frequencies."</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      The author makes no claims about the effectiveness or purpose of these frequencies, and this should be treated purely as an experimental demonstration.

      <p>
        The frequencies and signals discussed here‚Äîboth audio and RF-based‚Äîare experimental and speculative. This includes audio signals (such as 528 Hz, 432 Hz, and 17 kHz) and radio frequency claims (such as 1.42 GHz and 1.6 GHz). There is currently no scientifically validated evidence supporting claims of UAP attraction or interaction through these frequencies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Always approach these claims critically and consider existing scientific consensus. Some frequencies discussed (like the hydrogen line at 1.42 GHz or Skinwalker Ranch's 1.6 GHz) have known terrestrial or astronomical applications that may explain reported anomalies.
      </p>
      <p>
        High-frequency audio signals and electromagnetic emissions can pose health or interference risks if misused. Employ caution and appropriate technical equipment if experimenting with any signals discussed.
